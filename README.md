# Microsoft Work IQ (Public Preview)

> Query your Microsoft 365 data with natural language — emails, meetings, documents, Teams messages, and more.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@microsoft/workiq)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/workiq)

The WorkIQ CLI and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connects AI assistants to your Microsoft 365 Copilot data. Ask questions like *"What did my manager say about the project deadline?"* or *"Find my recent documents about Q4 planning."*

To access Microsoft 365 tenant data, the WorkIQ CLI and MCP Server need to be consented to permissions that require administrative rights on the tenant. On first access, a consent dialog appears. If you are not an administrator, contact your tenant administrator to grant access.

**For Tenant Administrators:** See the [Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide](./ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed instructions on granting admin consent, including a quick one-click consent URL.

For more information, see Microsoft's [User and Admin Consent Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview).

> ⚠️ **Public Preview:** Features and APIs may change.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have **Node.js** (which includes NPM and NPX) installed:

- **Node.js 18+** — [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify your installation by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

> 💡 **Why Node.js?** WorkIQ uses NPX to run the MCP server. NPX is included automatically with NPM, which comes bundled with Node.js.

## 🚀 Quick Start with GitHub Copilot CLI

The fastest way to get started is with GitHub Copilot CLI:

```bash
# 1. Open GitHub Copilot CLI
copilot

# 2. Install WorkIQ
/plugin install workiq@copilot-plugins
```

**That's it!** Restart Copilot CLI and start querying your M365 data:

```
You: What are my upcoming meetings this week?
You: Summarize emails from Sarah about the budget
You: Find documents I worked on yesterday
```

## 📦 Alternative: Standalone Installation

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=workiq&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fworkiq%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D)
[![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=workiq&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fworkiq%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

If you prefer to run WorkIQ as a standalone MCP server:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @microsoft/workiq

# Run the MCP server
workiq mcp
```

Or use npx without installing:

```bash
npx -y @microsoft/workiq mcp
```

Or add it as an MCP server in your coding agent or IDE:

```json
{
  "workiq": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@microsoft/workiq",
      "mcp"
    ],
    "tools": [
      "*"
    ]
  }
}
```

> Note: please refer to [use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) for the configuration instructions relative to Visual Studio Code.
